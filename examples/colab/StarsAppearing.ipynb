    "_Note_: `Colab` is a really handy way to test and try `strauss`, though it will generally run and display audio more slowly than running on your local machine. There are also RAM limitations that limit the size and complexity of sonifications we can make. For a more responsive experience, why not install `strauss` locally, following the instructions [on the Github](https://github.com/james-trayford/strauss)?"

Finally, the volume of the note is also related to the brightness of the star (dimmer stars are quieter).
