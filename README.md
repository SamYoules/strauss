## Sonification and STRAUSS

*"Sonification"* is the process of conveying data via the medium of sound. Sonification can be used to make scientific data more accessible to those with visual impairments, enhance visualisations and movies, and even convey information more efficiently than by visual means. The *STRAUSS* python package is intended to make sonification simple for both scientific and outreach applications.
