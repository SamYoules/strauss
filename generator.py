# TO DO:
# - Ultimately have Synth and Sampler classes that own their own stream (stream.py) object
#   allowing ADSR volume and filter enveloping, LFO implementation etc.
# - Functions here will generally be called from a "Score" class that is provided with the
#   musical choices and uses these to generate sound, but can be interfaced with directly.
